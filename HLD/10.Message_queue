A Message Queue is a communication system used to send messages between  different parts of a system, typically  
between microservices or distributed systems, in a decoupled, reliable, and asynchronous way.  

Letâ€™s break it down ðŸ‘‡

ðŸ”§ What is a Message Queue?
Think of it like a waiting line (queue) in a coffee shop:

One system/service sends messages to the queue (Producer)

Another reads messages from the queue (Consumer)

The Producer and Consumer donâ€™t need to run at the same time.

ðŸ“¬ Real-life Analogy
You order food on Swiggy (Producer)

Order goes into the kitchen queue (Message Queue)

Chef (Consumer) picks up the order when free

You donâ€™t need the chef to be free when you place the order. âœ…

| Term                        | Description                                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Producer**                | Sends the message to the queue                            |
| **Consumer**                | Processes the message from the queue                      |
| **Broker**                  | The system that manages the queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) |
| **Message**                 | The data being sent                                       |
| **Queue**                   | Holds the messages until they are consumed                |
| **Topic**                   | (in pub-sub) like a channel; consumers subscribe to it    |
| **Ack**                     | Acknowledgment sent after message is processed            |
| **Durable**                 | Message survives broker restart                           |
| **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** | Queue for failed messages after retries                   |


Why Use Message Queues?
| Benefit          | Explanation                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Asynchronous** | Producer doesnâ€™t wait for consumer           |
| **Scalable**     | Add more consumers to handle load            |
| **Decoupled**    | Services donâ€™t need to know about each other |
| **Reliable**     | Messages wonâ€™t be lost (if persistent)       |
| **Retry Logic**  | Failed messages can be retried               |


How does a Producer know that a Consumer has received and processed a message?
âœ… Answer:
This depends on the message queue system, but here are the common patterns:

Acknowledgment (Ack):

After processing the message, the Consumer sends an Ack to the Message Queue (Broker).

The Producer doesnâ€™t get a direct response, but the broker confirms that the message was delivered and processed.

Response Queue (Callback Queue):

The Producer includes a "reply-to" queue in the message.

After processing, the Consumer sends the result to this reply queue.

The Producer listens on that queue for a response
