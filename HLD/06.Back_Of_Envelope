Back of the envelope refers to quick, rough calculations or estimations done to get a basic understanding  
of a problem or system—often literally scribbled on the back of an envelope or a piece of paper.  
In software and system design, these calculations help you estimate things like:  

How much storage you’ll need  
How many requests per second your system must handle  
How much bandwidth is required  
How many servers you might need  

Why do back-of-the-envelope calculations?  
To check if your design is feasible  
To identify potential bottlenecks early  
To communicate ideas quickly with others  

Example:  
Suppose you’re designing a photo-sharing app.  

Question:  
How much storage do you need for 1 million users, each uploading 10 photos of 5 MB each?  

Calculation:  

Total photos = 1,000,000 users × 10 photos = 10,000,000 photos  
Total storage = 10,000,000 × 5 MB = 50,000,000 MB = 50,000 GB = 50 TB  

Conclusion:  
You’ll need at least 50 TB of storage.  

Summary:  
Back-of-the-envelope calculations are quick, simple estimates to guide your design decisions and check  
if your ideas are practical before doing detailed planning.  

Here’s a back-of-the-envelope calculation for the number of requests your system might need to handle:  

Example Scenario  
Suppose you are designing a web application.  

Users: 1 million (1,000,000)  
Average requests per user per day: 20  

Calculation  
Total requests per day:  
1,000,000 users × 20 requests = 20,000,000 requests/day  

Requests per second (RPS):  
There are 86,400 seconds in a day (24 × 60 × 60).  

20,000,000 requests ÷ 86,400 seconds ≈ 231 requests/second  

Summary Table  
Metric	Value  
Users	1,000,000  
Requests per user/day	20  
Total requests/day	20,000,000  
Requests/second	~231  

Conclusion:  
Your system should be designed to handle at least 231 requests per second at peak load  
(and ideally more, to handle spikes).
