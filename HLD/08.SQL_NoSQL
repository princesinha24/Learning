SQL vs NoSQL Databases
| Feature        | **SQL (Relational)**                     | **NoSQL (Non-Relational)**                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Format    | Tables (Rows & Columns)                  | JSON, Key-Value, Graph, Document, Column             |
| Schema         | **Fixed schema** (must define structure) | **Flexible schema** (structure can vary)             |
| Scalability    | **Vertical** (scale-up: stronger server) | **Horizontal** (scale-out: more servers)             |
| Transactions   | Supports ACID (strong consistency)       | Often BASE (eventual consistency, high availability) |
| Query Language | SQL (Structured Query Language)          | Varies: MongoDB uses its own, Redis uses commands    |
| Best for       | Complex queries, joins, strong integrity | Fast development, large-scale, dynamic data          |
| Examples       | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL        | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, DynamoDB                  |


| Property                                                          | SQL (ACID)                    | NoSQL (BASE)             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A ‚Äì Atomicity                                                     | All steps succeed or none do  | Partial success possible |
| C ‚Äì Consistency                                                   | Data always valid             | Eventually consistent    |
| I ‚Äì Isolation                                                     | No intermediate steps exposed | Loosely enforced         |
| D ‚Äì Durability                                                    | Once committed, stays saved   | Same                     |
| **BASE** ‚Äì Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent |                               |                          |
	

üß† When to Use SQL
Use SQL when:

Data has relationships (foreign keys, joins)

You need strong consistency

Structure is stable (e.g., fixed fields)

You run complex queries or analytics

‚úÖ Real-Life Example:
Banking System

Tables for Users, Accounts, Transactions

Ensures no money is lost during transfer

Strong consistency is critical

üí° Best choice: PostgreSQL / MySQL

üß† When to Use NoSQL
Use NoSQL when:

You have large volume of unstructured data

Data model changes frequently

You want high write/read speed

You need to scale out easily

‚úÖ Real-Life Example:
E-commerce App

Products with varying fields (shoes have size, books don‚Äôt)

High traffic during sales ‚Üí needs horizontal scaling

Customers, orders, product reviews stored as documents

üí° Best choice: MongoDB (Document DB)

üîç Common NoSQL Types
Type	Example Use Case	Tech
Document	Blog, product catalogs	MongoDB, CouchDB
Key-Value	Caching, session storage	Redis, DynamoDB
Column	Analytics, time series	Cassandra, HBase
Graph	Social networks, fraud detection	Neo4j, ArangoDB

üöÄ Summary Cheat Sheet
Use Case	Use SQL?	Use NoSQL?	Best DB Type
Banking / Finance	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No	Relational (SQL)
Social Media (posts, likes, feeds)	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes	Document / Graph
Product Catalog with flexible schema	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes	Document (MongoDB)
Real-time Analytics	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes	Column (Cassandra)
Inventory System (small to medium)	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No	SQL
Chat App with fast message storage	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes	Key-Value (Redis)

ACID -> SQL
| Property            | Meaning (Simple Terms)                                                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A** ‚Äì Atomicity   | All or nothing. Either the whole transaction happens or none of it.                |
| **C** ‚Äì Consistency | The database stays in a valid state before and after the transaction.              |
| **I** ‚Äì Isolation   | Each transaction runs **independently**. No one sees intermediate/partial changes. |
| **D** ‚Äì Durability  | Once a transaction is committed, it will survive a system crash.                   |

Real-Life Example: Money Transfer
Scenario: You transfer ‚Çπ100 from your Account A to Account B.

Atomicity: If ‚Çπ100 is deducted from A but not added to B, the whole thing rolls back.

Consistency: The total balance in the system remains the same.

Isolation: While your transfer is processing, no one else sees half-changes.

Durability: Even if the server crashes right after transfer, the transaction won‚Äôt be lost.


BASE -> NoSQL
| Property                      | Meaning (Simple Terms)                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **B** ‚Äì Basically Available   | The system is mostly available (some delays/errors are okay).           |
| **S** ‚Äì Soft State            | Data can change over time (even without input) due to replication.      |
| **E** ‚Äì Eventually Consistent | All copies of the data will be the same **eventually** (not instantly). |

You post a review, but your friend doesn‚Äôt see it immediately.

Basically Available: System doesn‚Äôt crash, still usable.

Soft State: Your review may be visible on some servers before others.

Eventually Consistent: Within a few seconds or minutes, all servers will show the same review.

| Feature        | **ACID (SQL)**                        | **BASE (NoSQL)**                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Focus          | Data consistency and integrity        | Availability and scalability        |
| Speed          | Slower (safe and reliable)            | Faster (relaxed consistency)        |
| Ideal for      | Banking, financial, inventory systems | Social media, e-commerce, analytics |
| Data Integrity | Strong                                | Weak (but eventually correct)       |
| Scalability    | Difficult (vertical scaling)          | Easy (horizontal scaling)           |

Let‚Äôs compare SQL and NoSQL using an example app: a simple E-commerce Product Catalog.

üõçÔ∏è Scenario: Product Catalog
Each product has:

id

name

price

category

tags

Optional: discount, size, etc.

‚úÖ SQL (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL)

Edit
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    tags TEXT[], -- PostgreSQL array
    discount DECIMAL(5,2),
    size VARCHAR(10)
);
üîπ Insert
sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO products (name, price, category, tags, discount, size)
VALUES ('Nike Shoes', 99.99, 'Footwear', ARRAY['sports', 'running'], 10.00, '9');
üîπ Query: Products under ‚Çπ100 in 'Footwear'
sql
Copy

üîπ Query: Products with tag 'sports'

  "discount": 10.00,
  "size": "9"
