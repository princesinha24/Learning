2-Phase Commit Protocol:

🧠 Flow Explanation (Lame Terms):
🟠 Phase 1: Prepare Phase
The Coordinator asks all Participants: “Are you ready to commit?”

Each Participant replies with either:

✅ Yes (I’m ready)

❌ No (Something’s wrong, I can’t)

🟢 Phase 2: Commit or Abort
If all Participants say Yes, the Coordinator says: “Okay, commit!”

If anyone says No, the Coordinator tells everyone to abort.

🔑 Keywords:
Coordinator: The boss who coordinates the transaction.

Prepare: Ask if they're ready.

Commit: Finalize changes.
