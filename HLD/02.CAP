CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you canâ€™t have 
Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance all at once. 
If thereâ€™s a network failure, you must choose between being 
correct (Consistency) or always available (Availability).

ðŸ§  Important Keywords (Simple Definitions)
Term                Meaning
Consistency         All users see the same data.
Availability        System always responds (no hanging).
Partition Tolerance System survives network issues.

Partition Tolerance: If a network failure occurs (partition), the system 
still works fine (some data may be unavailable). This is the most important 
part of CAP as it's the only way to ensure the system is always available (A). 
This means that if one node is down, the other nodes should still be able to 
communicate with each other.


We can't have all three properties at the same time.
Partition Tolerance is the most important property. and should be there always in distributed system.
