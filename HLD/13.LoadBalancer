A load balancer is a system that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers so that no single server gets overloaded. It helps ensure high availability, reliability, and scalability of services. Let’s break this down simply 👇

🧰 What is a Load Balancer?
Imagine a restaurant with one cashier and a long line of customers. Now imagine the restaurant adds 3 more cashiers and a person at the front (the load balancer) who directs customers to the least busy cashier.

That “person” is the load balancer in computing.

⚙️ What It Does:
Sits between client and backend servers

Distributes client requests to one of the available servers

Monitors server health and skips failed ones

Improves response time and fault tolerance

📊 Load Balancing Algorithms
1. Round Robin
Sends requests to servers one by one in a circular order.

Doesn’t consider server load.

🧠 Simple but not ideal for uneven workloads.

Example:
Request 1 → Server A
Request 2 → Server B
Request 3 → Server C
Request 4 → Server A again...

2. Least Connections
Sends the next request to the server with the fewest active connections.

Good when requests vary in length.

Use case: Long-lived connections like database or video streaming.

3. IP Hash
Uses the client's IP address to decide which server to send the request to.

Ensures same client always goes to same server.

Good for session stickiness (stateful applications).

4. Weighted Round Robin / Least Connections
Each server is given a weight (based on capacity).

Servers with higher weight get more requests.

Example:

Server A (weight 5)

Server B (weight 2)

Server A gets ~70% of the traffic.

5. Random
Just picks a server randomly.

Surprisingly effective in some cases.

6. Consistent Hashing
Mostly used in distributed systems and databases.

Ensures minimum re-distribution of requests when servers are added/removed.

🧪 Real-World Example:
You're accessing Netflix.

Netflix has 100s of servers across regions.

A load balancer:

Checks if the nearest server is alive

Routes your video stream request to the best available one

Balances other users across all those servers
