CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern that separates the responsibilities of reading data  
(queries) and writing data (commands) into two distinct models. This separation allows for better scalability, performance,  
and maintainability in complex systems.  

Key Concepts:  
Command: Operations that modify the state of the system (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting data).  
Query: Operations that retrieve data without modifying it.  
Separation: Commands and queries use different models, databases, or even services.  

Flow Chart:  
Here’s a simplified flow chart for CQRS:  
User Action  
    ↓  
Command (Write) → Command Handler → Write Database  
    ↓  
Query (Read) → Query Handler → Read Database  

Command Flow: When a user performs an action that modifies data (e.g., creating an order), the command is processed  
by a command handler and stored in the write database.  
Query Flow: When a user requests data (e.g., viewing order details), the query is processed by a query handler and  
fetched from the read database.  

Example:  
Imagine an e-commerce system where users can place orders and view order details.  

Command (Write):  
A user places an order.  
The system processes the command (e.g., validates the order, calculates totals).  
The order is saved in the write database.  

Query (Read):  
The user wants to view their order history.  
The system fetches the data from the read database, optimized for fast retrieval.  

Code Example:  
Here’s a basic implementation in Python:  

Command (Write):  
class PlaceOrderCommand:  
     def __init__(self, order_id, items):  
          self.order_id = order_id  
          self.items = items  

class CommandHandler:  
     def handle(self, command):  
          # Logic to save order to the write database  
          print(f"Order {command.order_id} placed with items: {command.items}")  

# Example usage  
command = PlaceOrderCommand(order_id=1, items=["item1", "item2"])  
handler = CommandHandler()  
handler.handle(command)  

Query (Read):  
class GetOrderQuery:  
     def __init__(self, order_id):  
          self.order_id = order_id  

class QueryHandler:  
     def handle(self, query):  
          # Logic to fetch order from the read database  
          print(f"Fetching details for order {query.order_id}")  

# Example usage  
query = GetOrderQuery(order_id=1)  
handler = QueryHandler()  
handler.handle(query)  

Benefits:  
Scalability: Read and write operations can scale independently.  
Performance: Read models can be optimized for queries, while write models focus on consistency.  
Flexibility: Different databases or technologies can be used for reads and writes.
