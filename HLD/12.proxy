A proxy is like a middleman that sits between a client (like your browser) and a server (like a website).

It forwards your request to another server and then returns the response back to you.

Types of Proxies
1. Forward Proxy
🔍 What it does:
Sits in front of the client.

The client sends requests to the proxy, and the proxy sends those to the internet.

It hides the client’s identity from the server.

🧠 Use case:
Bypassing firewalls

Browsing anonymously

Corporate network restrictions

Client --> Forward Proxy --> Target Server



2. Reverse Proxy
🔁 What it does:
Sits in front of the server.

The client thinks it’s directly contacting the server.

The reverse proxy hides the server’s details and distributes traffic.

🧠 Use case:
Load balancing

SSL termination

Caching static content

Security (Hiding internal servers)
